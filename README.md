Goal: Run Script, take user input and export/append price of the product to the table so you can monitor price over time.
Resources: Using Request and BS4 modules to create the script. (take a look at 'DO THIS BEFORE RUNNING')
Language: English / Output will be in whatever language site is set to.
Prog. Language: Python 3

About the code: It should be easy to configure and run. Could increase run time if there will be
	an multiple site scraper in only one run. Output should be easy to read if configured correctly.
				
	Require minimal knowledge of html/CSS, python 3 and pip installed on run envirement
				
	First run the 'requirement.txt' with command prompt, enter the following command: pip install -r <path/to/requirement.txt>
	Then you can run as it is or check config file.
				
	For other site scrap add look at how config file is wrote. For remove you can delete or change on CHECK column from 1 to 
	other value or vice-versa, where 1 means it will run and scrap the site or 0 to not scrap scrap the site.
				
	Program stop if there is an error. Please provide feedback!
	If you did something wrong the output will be most probably some text that was randomly scraped from site.
